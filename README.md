# golfMapsR

The <strong>golfMapsR</strong> repository uses golf course geoJSON data from Google Earth to make plots in R using ggplot2. Individual shots can be layered on top of these maps programatically, assuming the coordinates of shots are known. 

Use the <strong>Issues</strong> template to request a new course mapping.
